# Y.A.W.S.

_Yet Another WWII Shoot `em up_

This was the game created in the [DevCon/IGDA HTML5 Game Development Camp](http://devcon.ph/events/game-development-camp) last 24 May 2014.

You can learn how the students made this game via the workshop manual [HTML5 Shoot 'em Up in an Afternoon](https://leanpub.com/html5shootemupinanafternoon) (well, at least 80% of the game).
